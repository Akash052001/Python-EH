# mac address changer
>**Introduction**
 
**What is MAC Address?** MAC Address or Media Access Control address is a 48 bit unique identifier for NIC Hardware present on devices (mobile, computer, network devices).

In general world it acts as a unique identity for your devices on the network so that other devices will know with whom they are talking.

_**Benifits of mac spoofing:**_
1. **Free Internet:** There are places where you go get the wifi password but can’t access the network because they have activated MAC filtering so spoof your MAC to allowed devices and have fun.
2. **Identity Protection:** As I told you it’s your identity on the network so you can protect your identity on that network.
3. **Stop Tracking:** Now in the world of wifi zones companies try to keep track of users by recording the MAC address so spoofing MAC randomly can save you from that as well.
